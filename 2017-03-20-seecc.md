# Quantifying population change

Lalallal text this is what we will be doing efficient workflow, etc, working with large datasets, insert Hadley's workflow diagram or remake it in a prettier way

Open up a new R Script where you will be adding the code for this tutorial. All the resources for this tutorial, including some helpful cheatsheets can be downloaded from [this repository](https://github.com/ourcodingclub/SEECC-workshop) Clone and download the repo as a zipfile, then unzip and set the folder as your working directory by running the code below (subbing in the actual folder path), or clicking `Session/ Set Working Directory/ Choose Directory` from the RStudio menu.

Alternatively, you can fork [the repository](https://github.com/ourcodingclub/SEECC-workshop) to your own Github account and then add it as a new RStudio project by copying the HTTPS / SSH link. For more details on how to register on Github, download git, sync RStudio and Github and use version control, please check out our previous <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/02/27/git.html">tutorial.</a>

## 1. Understand the format required for analyses in R, and how to achieve it

### Reshaping data frames using `gather()`

The way you record information in the field or in the lab is probably very different to the way you want your data entered into R. In the field, you want tables that you can ideally draw up ahead and fill in as you go, and you will be adding notes and all sorts of information in addition to the data you want to analyse. For instance, if you monitor the height of seedlings during a factorial experiment using warming and fertilisation treatments, you might record your data like this:

<center> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/SAB_fig1.png" alt="Img" style="width: 500px;"/> </center>

Let's say you want to run a test to determine whether warming and/or fertilisation affected seedling growth. You may know how your experiment is set up, but R doesn't! At the moment, with 8 measures per row (combination of all treatments and species for one replicate, or block), you cannot run an analysis. On the contrary,
<a href="https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10">tidy datasets</a> are arranged so that each **row** represents an **observation** and each **column** represents a **variable**. In our case, this would look something like this:

<center> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/SAB_fig2.png" alt="Img" style="width: 400px;"/> </center>

This makes a much longer dataframe row-wise, which is why this form is often called *long format*. Now if you wanted to compare between groups, treatments, species, etc, R would be able to split the dataframe correctly, as each grouping factor has its own column.

The `gather()` function from the `tidyr` package lets you convert a wide-format data frame to a tidy long-format data frame.

Have a look at the first few columns of the LPI data set (`LPIdata_Feb2016`) to see whether it is tidy:

```r
View(head(LPIdata_Feb2016))
```

At the moment, each row contains a population that has been monitored over time and towards the right of the data frame there are lots of columns with population estimates for each year. To make this data "tidy" (one column per variable) we can use `gather()` to transform the data so there is a new column containing all the years for each population and an adjacent column containing all the population estimates for those years:

```r
library(tidyr)
LPI_long <- gather(data = LPIdata_Feb2016, key = "year", value = "pop", select = 26:70)
```

This takes our original dataset `LPIdata_Feb2016` and creates a new column called `year`, fills it with column names from columns `26:70` and then uses the data from these columns to make another column called `pop`.

### Using sensible variable names

Have a look at the column names in `LPI_long`:

```r
names(LPIdata_Feb2016)
```

The variable names are a mixture of upper and lower case letters and use `.` to mark the end of a word. For the sake of consistency and making things easier to read, let's replace any `.` with `_` and make everything lower case:

```r
names(LPIdata_Feb2016) <- names(LPIdata_Feb2016) %>%
	gsub(".", "_", ., fixed = TRUE) %>%
	tolower(.)
```


## 2. Use efficient tools for manipulating your data

Now that our dataset is *tidy* we can start exploring it.

Let's create a few summary statistics and store them in a data frame:

```r

```




LPIdata_Feb2016$Country.list <- gsub(",","",LPIdata_Feb2016$Country.list, fixed = TRUE)
LPIdata_Feb2016$biome <- gsub("/","",LPIdata_Feb2016$biome, fixed = TRUE)

## 3. Automating data manipulation and visualisation
Often we want to perform the same type of analysis to multiple species, plots, or any other groups within our data - copying and pasting is inefficient and can easily lead to mistakes, so it's much better to automate the process within R and avoid all the repetition. There are several ways to do this, including using the `lapply()` function, loops, and pipes. For more information, you can check out our tutorials on <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/02/08/funandloops.html">loops</a> and <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/01/16/piping.html">piping</a>, but for now, here is a brief summary.

John to add a few sentences about lapply.

Loops are used for iterative purposes - through loops you are telling R to do something (calculate a mean, make a graph, anything) for each element of a certain list (could be a list of years, species, countries, any category within your data). Pipes are a way of streamlining this process - imagine all of your data coming in one end of the pipe, while they are in there, they are manipulated, plots are made, etc, then the output (e.g. your summary statistics or graphs) comes out the other end of the pipe. Within the pipe you can group by categories of your choice, so for example we can calculate the LPI for different biomes or countries, and then save the plots.

INSERT TABLE OF PROS AND CONS OF EACH? Then go through examples from each category.

lapply cons -
lapply pros - quicker than loops

Loops cons - can take longer to run, use up more memory; people tend to hate them, so when you ask for help with your loop, people just say not to use a loop
Loops pros - but loops are easy to understand, they make logical sense and do a fair job when your dataset is not humongous

Pipes cons - can take a bit of fiddling around to adjust the code
Pipes pros - more efficient, you can have all your data manipulation, visualisation and graph exporing into one pipe, quicker than loops

```r
# plots by bioime
biome <- data %>%
  mutate(Year = parse_number(Year)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(Pop) & Are.coordinates.for.specific.location.=="TRUE") %>%
  select(Common.Name,Location.of.population,Country.list,biome,Year,Pop,system,Native,Alien) %>%
  group_by(Common.Name,Location.of.population,Country.list,biome,system,Native,Alien) %>%
  filter(length(unique(Year)) > 2) %>%
  do(fit = lm(Pop ~ Year, data = .)) %>%
  tidy(fit) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(biome) %>%
  do(ggsave(ggplot(.,aes(x = estimate))+geom_histogram(),filename = gsub(" ","",paste("Biome_LPI/",unique(as.character(.$biome)),".pdf",sep="")),device="pdf"))

# plots by Country.list
Country.list <- data %>%
  mutate(Year = parse_number(Year)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(Pop) & Are.coordinates.for.specific.location.=="TRUE") %>%
  select(Common.Name,Location.of.population,Country.list,biome,Year,Pop,system,Native,Alien) %>%
  group_by(Common.Name,Location.of.population,Country.list,biome,system,Native,Alien) %>%
  filter(length(unique(Year)) > 2) %>%
  do(fit = lm(Pop ~ Year, data = .)) %>%
  tidy(fit) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(Country.list) %>%
  do(ggsave(ggplot(.,aes(x = estimate))+geom_histogram(),filename = gsub(" ","",paste("Country_LPI/",unique(as.character(.$Country.list)),".pdf",sep="")),device="pdf"))

```

       - Colourpicker
Setting custom colours for your graphs can set them apart from all the rest (we all know what the default `ggplot2` colours look like!), make them prettier, and most importantly, give your work a consistent and logical colour scheme. Finding the codes, e.g. `colour="#8B5A00"`, for your chosen colours, however, can be a bit tedious. Though one can always use Paint / Photoshop / google colour codes, there is a way to do this within RStudio thanks to the addin `colourpicker`. RStudio addins are installed the same way as packages, and you can access them by clicking on `Addins` in your RStudio menu. To install `colourpicker`, run the following code:

```r
install.packages("colourpicker")
```

To find out what is the code for a colour you like, click on `Addins/Colour picker`.

When you click on `All R colours` you will see lots of different colours you can choose from - a good colour scheme makes your graph stand out, but of course, don't go crazy with the colours. When you click on `1`, and then on a certain colour, you fill up `1` with that colour, same goes for `2`, `3` - you can add mode colours with the `+`, or delete them by clicking the bin. Once you've made your pick, click `Done`. You will see a line of code `c("#8B5A00", "#CD8500")` appear - in this case, we just need the colour code, so we can copy that, and delete the rest.
