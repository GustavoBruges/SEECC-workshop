### Quantifying population change

1. Tidyr functions

## 1. Understand the format required for analyses in R, and how to achieve it

The way you record information in the field or in the lab is probably very different to the way you want your data entered into R. In the field, you want tables that you can ideally draw up ahead and fill in as you go, and you will be adding notes and all sorts of information in addition to the data you want to analyse. For instance, if you monitor the height of seedlings during a factorial experiment using warming and fertilisation treatments, you might record your data like this:

<center> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/SAB_fig1.png" alt="Img" style="width: 500px;"/> </center>

Let's say you want to run a test to determine whether warming and/or fertilisation affected seedling growth. You may know how your experiment is set up, but R doesn't! At the moment, with 8 measures per row (combination of all treatments and species for one replicate, or block), you cannot run an analysis. On the contrary, 
<a href="https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10">tidy datasets</a> are arranged so that each **row** represents an **observation** and each **column** represents a **variable**. In our case, this would look something like this:

<center> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/SAB_fig2.png" alt="Img" style="width: 400px;"/> </center>

This makes a much longer dataframe row-wise, which is why this form is often called *long format*. Now if you wanted to compare between groups, treatments, species, etc, R would be able to split the dataframe correctly, as each grouping factor has its own column. 

The `gather()` function from the `tidyr` package lets you convert a wide-format table to a tidy dataframe.

2. Quick summary statistics for a dataset
3. Automating data manipulation and visualisation
   - lapply
	 - loops
	 - pipes
       - Colourpicker
Setting custom colours for your graphs can set them apart from all the rest (we all know what the default `ggplot2` colours look like!), make them prettier, and most importantly, give your work a consistent and logical colour scheme. Finding the codes, e.g. `colour="#8B5A00"`, for your chosen colours, however, can be a bit tedious. Though one can always use Paint / Photoshop / google colour codes, there is a way to do this within RStudio thanks to the addin `colourpicker`. RStudio addins are installed the same way as packages, and you can access them by clicking on `Addins` in your RStudio menu. To install `colourpicker`, run the following code:

```r
install.packages("colourpicker")
```

To find out what is the code for a colour you like, click on `Addins/Colour picker`.

When you click on `All R colours` you will see lots of different colours you can choose from - a good colour scheme makes your graph stand out, but of course, don't go crazy with the colours. When you click on `1`, and then on a certain colour, you fill up `1` with that colour, same goes for `2`, `3` - you can add mode colours with the `+`, or delete them by clicking the bin. Once you've made your pick, click `Done`. You will see a line of code `c("#8B5A00", "#CD8500")` appear - in this case, we just need the colour code, so we can copy that, and delete the rest.
